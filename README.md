# Restaurant Review App

This is the fifth project I completed for the Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.  Udacity provided the base code for a barely functioning website, and required that each student:
- Make the provided website fully responsive,
- Make the website available offline using a service worker and caching, and
- Make the site accessible (ARIA compliant).
